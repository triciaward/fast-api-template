## What is a Database?

Think of a database like a digital filing cabinet. It stores all your app's information in an organized way:
- **Users**: Account information, profiles, settings
- **Data**: Any information your app needs to remember
- **Relationships**: How different pieces of data connect to each other

## Real Example: Add a `bio` Field to User

Let's walk through a real example of adding a `bio` field to the user model, updating the schema, generating a migration, and using the new field via the API.

### 1. Update the SQLAlchemy Model ([app/models/models.py](../../app/models/models.py))
```python
class User(Base, SoftDeleteMixin):
    # ... existing fields ...
    bio = Column(String, nullable=True)
```

### 2. Update the Pydantic Schema ([app/schemas/user.py](../../app/schemas/user.py))
```python
class UserUpdate(BaseModel):
    bio: Optional[str] = None
```

### 3. Generate a Migration
```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "add bio to user"
```

### 4. Example Alembic Migration Output ([alembic/versions/xxxx_add_bio_to_user.py](../../alembic/versions/))
```python
def upgrade():
    op.add_column('users', sa.Column('bio', sa.String(), nullable=True))
def downgrade():
    op.drop_column('users', 'bio')
```

### 5. Apply the Migration
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

### 6. Use the New Field via API
```bash
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users/me" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"bio": "I love FastAPI!"}'
```

## Making a Database Change (Step-by-Step)

Suppose you want to add a new field (e.g., `bio`) to the User model. Here’s how you do it:

1. **Add the new field to the SQLAlchemy model** (`app/models/models.py`):
    ```python
    class User(Base, SoftDeleteMixin):
        # ... existing fields ...
        bio = Column(String, nullable=True)
    ```
2. **Update the schema** (`app/schemas/user.py`):
    ```python
    class UserUpdate(BaseModel):
        bio: Optional[str] = None
    ```
3. **Generate a migration**:
    ```bash
    alembic revision --autogenerate -m "add bio to user"
    ```
    - *Autogenerate* is great for most changes, but for complex operations (splitting tables, data migrations), you may want to hand-write the migration for full control.
4. **Review the migration file** (`alembic/versions/xxxx_add_bio_to_user.py`):
    ```python
    def upgrade():
        op.add_column('users', sa.Column('bio', sa.String(), nullable=True))
    def downgrade():
        op.drop_column('users', 'bio')
    ```
5. **Apply the migration**:
    ```bash
    alembic upgrade head
    ```
6. **Test the change**: Use the API or Python shell to confirm the new field works as expected.

> **CI/CD Note:**
> In production, migrations are usually applied automatically as part of your CI/CD pipeline (see deployment docs for details).

---

## Why Generate vs. Hand-Write a Migration?
- **Autogenerate**: Fast, safe for most schema changes (add/remove columns, simple types)
- **Hand-write**: Needed for complex changes (data migrations, renames, splitting tables, custom SQL)
- Always review autogenerated migrations before applying!

## Basic Database Operations

### Creating Data (INSERT)

To create a new user:

```python
# Using the API
POST /api/v1/auth/register
{
    "email": "newuser@example.com",
    "username": "newuser",
    "password": "SecurePassword123!"
}

# Using Python code
from app.crud.user import create_user_sync
from app.schemas.user import UserCreate

user_data = UserCreate(
    email="newuser@example.com",
    username="newuser",
    password="SecurePassword123!"
)
new_user = create_user_sync(db, user_data)
```

### Reading Data (SELECT)

To get user information:

```python
# Get current user
GET /api/v1/users/me

# Get user by ID
GET /api/v1/users/{user_id}

# Get all users (with pagination)
GET /api/v1/users?page=1&size=10
```

### Updating Data (UPDATE)

To update user information:

```python
# Update current user
PUT /api/v1/users/me
{
    "username": "newusername"
}

# Change password
POST /api/v1/auth/change-password
{
    "current_password": "OldPassword123!",
    "new_password": "NewPassword123!"
}
```

### Deleting Data (Soft Delete)

The template uses "soft delete" - data is hidden but not permanently removed:

```python
# Request account deletion
POST /api/v1/auth/request-account-deletion

# Confirm deletion (7-day grace period)
POST /api/v1/auth/confirm-account-deletion
{
    "token": "deletion_token_from_email"
}
```

---

## Advanced Database Features

### Search and Filter

The template includes powerful search and filtering capabilities:

```python
# Search users by name or email
GET /api/v1/users?search=john

# Filter by verification status
GET /api/v1/users?is_verified=true

# Combine search and filters
GET /api/v1/users?search=admin&is_superuser=true&page=1&size=20

# Sort results
GET /api/v1/users?sort_by=date_created&sort_order=desc
```

**Available filters:**
- `search`: Text search across multiple fields
- `is_verified`: Filter by email verification status
- `is_superuser`: Filter by admin status
- `oauth_provider`: Filter by login method
- `date_created`: Filter by creation date
- `is_deleted`: Filter by soft-deleted status (admin only)

> **Tip:** Filtering by `date_created` is useful for analytics and reporting. Filtering by `is_deleted` lets you view or restore soft-deleted records (admin endpoints only).

### Pagination

Handle large datasets efficiently:

```python
# Basic pagination
GET /api/v1/users?page=1&size=10

# Response includes pagination info
{
    "items": [...],
    "total": 150,
    "page": 1,
    "size": 10,
    "pages": 15,
    "has_next": true,
    "has_prev": false,
    "links": {
        "next": "/api/v1/users?page=2&size=10",
        "prev": null,
        "first": "/api/v1/users?page=1&size=10",
        "last": "/api/v1/users?page=15&size=10"
    }
}
```

### Audit Logging

Track all data changes automatically:

```python
# Audit logs are created automatically for:
# - User registration
# - Login attempts (success/failure)
# - Password changes
# - Account deletions
# - OAuth logins

# View audit logs (admin only)
GET /api/v1/admin/audit-logs?user_id=123&action=login&page=1&size=50
```

## Database Migrations

### What are Migrations?

Migrations are like a version control system for your database. They let you:
- **Track changes**: Keep history of database modifications
- **Roll back**: Undo changes if something goes wrong
- **Collaborate**: Share database changes with your team
- **Deploy safely**: Update production databases without losing data

### Creating a Migration

To add a new field to the User table:

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add phone number to users"

# This creates a file like: alembic/versions/abc123_add_phone_number.py
```

> **Reminder:** Alembic's `autogenerate` will NOT detect changes that only affect indexes, constraints, or some column types. If you add or change an index (e.g., `Index`, `UniqueConstraint`), you must manually edit the migration file to include those changes. Always review autogenerated migrations and add missing operations as needed!

### Running Migrations

```bash
# Apply all pending migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Roll back one migration
alembic downgrade -1

# Check current migration status
alembic current

# View migration history
alembic history
```

### Example Migration

Here's what a migration file looks like:

```python
# alembic/versions/abc123_add_phone_number.py
"""Add phone number to users

Revision ID: abc123def456
Revises: previous_migration_id
Create Date: 2024-01-15 10:30:00.000000

"""
from alembic import op
import sqlalchemy as sa

def upgrade():
    # Add phone_number column to users table
    op.add_column('users', sa.Column('phone_number', sa.String(), nullable=True))

def downgrade():
    # Remove phone_number column if we need to roll back
    op.drop_column('users', 'phone_number')
```

---

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set these in your `.env` file:

```env
# Database connection
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name

# Connection pool settings
DB_POOL_SIZE=20
DB_MAX_OVERFLOW=30
DB_POOL_RECYCLE=3600
DB_POOL_TIMEOUT=30
DB_POOL_PRE_PING=true
```

### Connection Pooling

The template uses connection pooling for better performance:

- **Pool Size**: Number of database connections to keep open
- **Max Overflow**: Additional connections when pool is full
- **Pool Recycle**: How often to refresh connections (1 hour)
- **Pool Timeout**: How long to wait for a connection (30 seconds)
- **Pool Pre-ping**: Test connections before using them

---

## Testing Database Operations

### Using the API

Test database operations through the API:

```bash
# 1. Create a user
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "username": "testuser",
    "password": "TestPassword123!"
  }'

# 2. Login to get access token
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=test@example.com&password=TestPassword123!"

# 3. Get user data
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users/me" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"

# 4. Search users
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/users?search=test&page=1&size=10"
```

### Using Python Code

Test database operations directly:

```python
from app.database.database import get_db
from app.crud.user import get_user_by_email_sync

# Get database session
db = next(get_db())

# Find user by email
user = get_user_by_email_sync(db, "test@example.com")
print(f"Found user: {user.username}")

# Close database session
db.close()
```
