## üöÄ Quick Solutions

### Most Common Environment Issues:
```bash
# Fix environment variables
./scripts/fix_env_issues.sh

# Check .env file
ls -la | grep -E "\.env"
cat .env

# Test database connection
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d fastapi_template -c "SELECT 1;"
```

### Most Common Setup Issues:
```bash
# Run comprehensive setup
./scripts/setup_comprehensive.sh

# Verify setup
python scripts/verify_setup.py

# Check database migrations
alembic current
```

### Docker not running / Docker Desktop closed

If the setup script reports Docker is not running, it now offers options to:
- Attempt to start Docker Desktop automatically (macOS/Windows) or the Docker service (Linux)
- Retry detection
- Continue without Docker (skips containers) and shows follow-up commands

You can always start Docker later and run:
```bash
docker-compose up -d postgres
alembic upgrade head
docker-compose up -d api
```
