## 🚀 Quick Solutions

### Environment & Setup Issues
```bash
# Fix environment variables
./scripts/fix_env_issues.sh

# Check .env file
ls -la | grep -E "\.env"
cat .env

# Test database connection
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d fastapi_template -c "SELECT 1;"
```

### Docs Page Appears Blank at /docs
- The template serves a custom Swagger UI with CDN fallbacks and a CSP relaxed only for docs.
- Refresh the page once after start; if still blank, check browser console for CSP errors.
- In restricted networks, allowlist `unpkg.com` and `cdnjs.cloudflare.com`, or host Swagger UI assets locally by editing `app/main.py`.

### Testing & CI Issues
```bash
# Run validation before pushing
./scripts/development/validate_ci.sh

# Run tests locally

```

### Development Workflow Issues
```bash
# Template customization workflow
./scripts/rename_template.sh
# Restart VS Code (CRITICAL!)
./scripts/customize_template.sh
./scripts/setup_project.sh
```

### Code Quality Issues
```bash
# Fix formatting
python -m black .

# Fix linting
python -m ruff check . --fix

# Check types
python -m mypy app/ scripts/

# Fix pre-commit hooks not working
