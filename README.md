# Your Project Name

Welcome to your new FastAPI project! 🎉

This is your project's main README file - feel free to customize it to describe what your application does, how to use it, and any specific features you've built.

## 🚀 Getting Started

If you're new to this project, here's how to get it running:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis (optional, for caching)

### Quick Setup

**Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)**
```bash
# Run the comprehensive setup script
./scripts/setup_comprehensive.sh
```
This script will automatically:
- Create a virtual environment
- Install dependencies
- Set up your `.env` file
- Start the database
- Run migrations
- Verify everything is working

**Option 2: Manual Setup**
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set up your environment:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your database and other settings
   ```

3. **Set up the database:**
   ```bash
   # Run database migrations
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

4. **Start your application:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

Your API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

## 📚 API Documentation

Once your app is running, you can explore your API:

- **Interactive API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Alternative API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/redoc

## 🐳 Running with Docker

If you prefer using Docker:

```bash
# Start everything with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Application

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage report
pytest --cov=app
```

## 🔧 Development Workflow

```bash
# Start development server
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Format your code
ruff format .

# Check for code issues
ruff check .
```
