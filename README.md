# Your Project Name

Welcome to your new FastAPI project! 🎉

This is your project's main README file - feel free to customize it to describe what your application does, how to use it, and any specific features you've built.

## 🚀 Getting Started

**📖 Complete Setup Guide**: For detailed setup instructions, see [docs/TEMPLATE_README.md](docs/TEMPLATE_README.md)

The setup process involves:
1. **Create a new GitHub repository** (critical to avoid overwriting the template)
2. **Clone your new repository** to your local machine
3. **Rename the template directory** using `./scripts/setup/rename_template.sh`
4. **Restart VS Code** and open the renamed directory
5. **Customize the template** using `./scripts/setup/customize_template.sh`
6. **Set up your project** using `./scripts/setup/setup_project.sh`

**⚠️ Important**: Always create a new GitHub repository first to avoid accidentally overwriting the template!

**🆘 Need Help?**: If you encounter issues during setup, see the [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/troubleshooting/TROUBLESHOOTING_README.md)
