**🎯 Perfect for:** Solo developers building their own projects, side hustles, and apps that might grow into something bigger.

**⚡ What makes this special:** Everything you need to build cool stuff, with room to grow. No over-engineering, just solid foundations for your ideas.

## 🚀 Getting Started

**🎯 STREAMLINED SETUP** - One command does everything!

> **⚠️ For Users with AI Assistants**: The setup script must be run by YOU personally, not by your AI assistant. See the setup instructions below for details.

### 📋 Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- **Python 3.11+** installed on your system
- **Docker Desktop** installed and running
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

**💡 Don't have Python?** Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

**💡 Don't have Docker?** Download [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

### Quick Setup (GitHub Template)

**🎯 RECOMMENDED APPROACH** - Use GitHub's template feature:

```bash
# 1. Click "Use this template" button above to create your repo
# 2. Clone YOUR new repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-project-name.git
cd your-project-name

# 3. Run the setup script (IMPORTANT: You must do this personally!)
./scripts/setup/setup_project.py
```

> **🚨 IMPORTANT**: You **must run the setup script yourself** in your terminal!
> 
> **❌ Do NOT ask AI assistants** (like Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor AI, etc.) to run this script
> 
> **✅ Instead**: Open your terminal and run `./scripts/setup/setup_project.py` directly
>
> **Why?** The script requires personal input to customize your project details and has built-in protections against automation.

**That's it!** The script will automatically:
- ✅ Customize all files with your project details
- ✅ Set up Python environment and dependencies
- ✅ Start database services
- ✅ Run migrations and create superuser
- ✅ Install git protection hooks
- ✅ Verify everything works

### 🔍 Verify It's Working

```bash
# Check the API is running
curl http://localhost:8000/system/health
# Expected: {"status": "healthy", "timestamp": "..."}

# View the interactive API docs
open http://localhost:8000/docs

# Run the test suite
pytest
# Expected: 173 files, 561 passed, 98% coverage
```

### What You Get
The setup script creates a **fully working API** with all the features you need to build cool stuff. You'll be coding in minutes, not hours.

**📖 Complete Setup Guide**: For detailed information, see [docs/TEMPLATE_README.md](docs/TEMPLATE_README.md)

**🆘 Need Help?**: If you encounter issues, see the [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/troubleshooting/TROUBLESHOOTING_README.md)

### 🤖 AI Assistant Users - READ THIS!

If you're using AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor AI, etc.), they might offer to run the setup script for you. **Don't let them!**

**❌ What will happen if AI tries to run it:**
```
❌ This script requires interactive mode.
   You must run this script directly in a terminal.
   Automated/non-interactive execution is not supported.
```

**✅ What you should do instead:**
1. Open your terminal application (Terminal on Mac, Command Prompt on Windows)
2. Navigate to your project folder: `cd your-project-name`
3. Run the script yourself: `./scripts/setup/setup_project.py`
4. Answer the questions personally to customize your project

**💡 Why this matters:** The setup script customizes your project with your personal details (project name, author info, database settings). This requires human input and thoughtful answers!
